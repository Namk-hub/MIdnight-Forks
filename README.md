# Midnight Forks

Midnight Forks is a simple restaurant landing page I built using **just HTML and CSS**.  
The idea was to create a cozy, late-night food vibe with bold visuals and a clean layout — something fun but still structured.

This project helped me practice:
- page layout
- image handling
- fonts & colors


 **Live site:**

No JavaScript yet — this is purely a front-end layout project.
